Q4. String operations

Problem Description
Akash likes playing with strings. One day he thought of applying
 following operations on the string in the given order:
Concatenate the string with itself.
Delete all the uppercase letters.
Replace each vowel with '#'.
You are given a string A of size N consisting of lowercase and uppercase
 alphabets. Return the resultant string after applying the above operations.
NOTE: 'a' , 'e' , 'i' , 'o' , 'u' are defined as vowels.

Problem Constraints
1<=N<=100000

Input Format
First argument is a string A of size N.

Output Format
Return the resultant string.

Example Input
Input 1:
A="aeiOUz"
Input 2:
A="AbcaZeoB"

Example Output
Output 1:
"###z###z"
Output 2:
"bc###bc###"

Example Explanation
Explanatino 1:
First concatenate the string with itself so string A becomes "aeiOUzaeiOUz".
Delete all the uppercase letters so string A becomes "aeizaeiz".
Now replace vowel with '#', A becomes "###z###z".
Explanatino 2:
First concatenate the string with itself so string A becomes "AbcaZeoBAbcaZeoB".
Delete all the uppercase letters so string A becomes "bcaeobcaeo".
Now replace vowel with '#', A becomes "bc###bc###".
