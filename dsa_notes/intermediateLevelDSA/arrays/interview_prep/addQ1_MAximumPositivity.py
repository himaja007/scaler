Q1. Maximum positivity
Problem Description
Given an array of integers A, of size N.
Return the maximum size subarray of A having only non-negative elements.
 If there are more than one such subarray, return the one having the smallest
 starting index in A.
NOTE: It is guaranteed that an answer always exists.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
-109 <= A[i] <= 109

Input Format
The first and only argument given is the integer array A.
Output Format
Return maximum size subarray of A having only non-negative elements.
 If there are more than one such subarrays, return the one having earliest
 starting index in A.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [5, 6, -1, 7, 8]
Input 2:
 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


Example Output
Output 1:
 [5, 6]
Output 2:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 There are two subarrays of size 2 having only non-negative elements.
 1. [5, 6]  starting point  = 0
 2. [7, 8]  starting point  = 3
 As starting point of 1 is smaller, return [5, 6]

Explanation 2:
 There is only one subarray of size 6 having only non-negative elements:
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
